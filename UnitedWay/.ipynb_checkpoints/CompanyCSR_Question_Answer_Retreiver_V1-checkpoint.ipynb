    "### üîß Key Components:\n",
    "- **Document Loader:** Loads CSR PDFs using `PyPDFLoader`.\n",
    "- **Text Chunking:** Splits text into overlapping chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.\n",
    "- **Embeddings:** Generates embeddings using `OpenAIEmbeddings` (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).\n",
    "- **Vector Store:** Stores embeddings in a Chroma vector database.\n",
    "- **LLM Response Generation:** Uses `gpt-4o-mini` via `ChatOpenAI` to answer questions based on retrieved chunks.\n",
    "- **Custom Prompt:** Ensures grounded answers using a structured prompt template.\n",

Our team‚Äôs efforts and \\nresilience during a very challenging period resulted in Titan closing 2020 in a good position with strong momentum. \\nIn response, Titan also looked closely at many of our business processes, policies and activities, including the work found in this \\nreport. We learned there was room for improvement and set a plan for change. In May 2021, we became a signatory of the United \\nNations Global Compact, adopting its 10 principles on human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. In addition, we \\nupdated governing documents and policies in line with these principles. \\nWe revisited our policies on encouraging workplace diversity across many perspectives, including ensuring Board of Directors \\noversight that reflected our philosophy. In March 2021, we welcomed the addition of Laura K. Thompson as our first female \\ndirector and will embrace her deep financial and business expertise established over her 35-year career with the Goodyear Tire & \\nRubber Company. \\nTitan is committed to continuous improvement to lower our impact on the environment. Whether it is creating tires that reduce \\nsoil compaction, helping our customers increase yield, closely tracking our business operations to identify ways to reduce the use \\nof harmful solvents, finding use for recycled materials or discovering new ways to design our facilities more sustainably, we are \\nmaking strides toward lessening our impact. \\nIn this inaugural report, we demonstrate that Titan is taking action by launching a dedicated portion of our investor relations \\nwebsite to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and reporting how our results align with the Sustainable Accounting \\nStandards Board (SASB), as shown in a table listed at the back of this report.

We continuously seek to reduce our impact on the environment by adopting eco-design principles.\\nWHEELS\\nAs modern agriculture equipment continues to increase in size and weight, wheel design becomes increasingly important. \\nIt's the reason we work side by side with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to develop innovative solutions for \\na variety of agriculture, construction, forestry and mining equipment. Wheel designs and their associated weight have a \\ndirect impact on the overall performance, fuel efficiency and longevity of the machine. Part of that collaborative effort is \\nto meet the design, strength and sustainability goals for both Titan and the OEMs, who are interested not only in utilizing \\neco-friendly processes, but in improving equipment performance.\\n7\"),\n",

In 2002, Titan transitioned \\nto waterborne paint technology for all of our agricultural wheels. This \\nconscientious change removed the need for solvents with high volatile \\norganic compounds (VOC) concentration from all of our wheel factories. The \\nswitch offers superior quality while significantly reducing hazardous waste \\nand air pollutants. Since 2007, the powder coat process has been expanded \\nto include all of our small and medium-sized agricultural wheels, and in \\n2012 a new state-of-the-art powder coat facility was built for finishing large agricultural wheels. Our current waterborne  \\nurethane and powder production paints do not require solvents in their application, and powder coating decreases  \\nremnant paint waste. \\nWe also inspect circumferential weld joints using X-ray and ultrasound systems prior to applying paint. These steps \\nhelp to ensure we are producing the highest-quality wheels to hold up to the harsh working environments and rigorous \\napplications for our customers, regardless of distribution channel.\\nThe energy used to produce steel wheels creates significantly less carbon dioxide emissions than producing a comparable \\nset of aluminum wheels. Titan purchases a significant amount of the steel it consumes from mini mills that are using \\nmostly recycled steel material versus integrated mills that produce steel from raw iron ore. Although there are some \\nOEMs looking into aluminum wheel options, we believe that steel wheel production is the more energy-efficient, eco-\\nfriendly option with simpler and less energy-intensive recycling options at the end of a product‚Äôs life cycle.\\nWe are committed to advancing our design and production methods while keeping our customers‚Äô needs in mind. We \\nbelieve we can achieve our sustainability goals and continue to support our customers with durable and high-quality \\nproducts that withstand the harsh conditions of the agriculture, construction, forestry and mining industries. \\nTIRES\\nBeginning in 2009, Titan has aimed to stay one step ahead in eco-design and compliance \\nby eliminating any potential problematic chemicals in our rubber compounds. Further, Titan \\nincorporates recycled ground rubber in the rubber compounds used in our tires. In 2021, 3.3 \\nmillion pounds of ground rubber were used in our Union City, Tenn., facility and distributed to \\nall three of our North American plants.\\nEnvironmental and social gains can go beyond tire production as well. One example is our \\nLow Sidewall Technology\\n¬Æ (LSW¬Æ) tires, where the assembly features a smaller tire sidewall \\nand larger wheel. LSW significantly reduces power hop, road lope and soil compaction, \\nwhich improves safety and equipment performance. LSW tires allow for the tractor to carry \\nthe same weight at 40% lower inflation pressures than a standard tire, significantly reducing soil compaction, which can \\npotentially result in greater crop yields. When there is less soil compaction, the end-user farmers become better stewards \\nof the land because they can implement lessened deep tillage during field preparations which also reduces fuel and energy \\nuse. See page 10 for further information. \\nIn 2021, we released our AgraEDGE‚Ñ¢ tire line, which reduced tire weight by 7% compared to previous models. This full-\\nline tire offering was released to replace old models, with Titan expecting to reduce materials used by 1.1 million pounds \\nannually. The success has prompted additional product evaluation in other tire lines.'),\n",

ITM continues to test \\nalternative lubricant solutions to improve the performance of the product  \\nwhile limiting soil contamination.\\nSince 2004, ITM has been using microalloyed steel in shaft production for idlers and rollers. The chemical composition of this \\nsteel guarantees the required mechanical properties without the traditional quench and temper process. This translates into \\nsignificantly lower energy consumption and gas emissions.

This eliminates one heating step and \\nthe resulting energy usage and gas emissions.\\n ‚Ä¢  In 2020, ITM joined IMDS¬Æ (International Material Data System).
