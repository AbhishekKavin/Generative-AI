    "# üìò Company CSR Question-Answer Retriever ‚Äì V2\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for extracting information from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports. Users can ask natural language questions and receive grounded, context-aware answers based on the content of the uploaded PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook follows a modular RAG architecture built using LangChain and OpenAI, structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. üìÑ Document Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "CSR reports in PDF format are parsed using multiple tools to handle structured and unstructured content:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pdfplumber` and `fitz` for text extraction.\n",
    "- `pytesseract` and `PIL` for OCR of scanned images.\n",
    "- `camelot` for extracting tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. ‚úÇÔ∏è Text Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted document is split into manageable text chunks using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunk size: 1000 characters  \n",
    "- Overlap: 200 characters  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures important context is preserved across chunks for better retrieval relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. üß† Embedding and Vector Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunked text is embedded and stored for semantic search using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n",
    "from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each text chunk is embedded using OpenAI‚Äôs embedding model.\n",
    "- The resulting vectors are stored in a Chroma vector store to enable efficient similarity-based retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. üîé Query + Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user submits a question, the system performs semantic search to retrieve the most relevant chunks from the stored embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These retrieved documents provide the contextual foundation for answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. üßæ Prompt Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "A structured prompt is constructed by combining the retrieved context and the user‚Äôs question:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use the following context to answer the question. Don‚Äôt guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "{context}\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: {question}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the model generates responses grounded only in the available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. ü§ñ Response Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt is passed to a language model to generate the final response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the structured context and query to return a relevant and accurate answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for answering natural language questions over CSR PDFs. It uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-tool PDF parsing  \n",
    "- Overlapping text chunking  \n",
    "- OpenAI-powered embeddings  \n",
    "- Chroma-based semantic search  \n",
    "- Prompt-based interaction with a chat model  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is suitable for tasks such as ESG reporting, compliance auditing, and document intelligence across long, unstructured enterprise PDFs.\n"
