# 🧠 Generative AI Projects Collection

Welcome to the **Generative AI Projects Collection**—a suite of hands-on projects that demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative technologies in solving real-world problems.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for various applications such as summarization, chatbot interactions, UI integrations, and more. Each project showcases a specific use case for generative AI, ranging from productivity tools to AI model evaluation.
